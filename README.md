# Brazil_Ecommerce-EDA

This academic project aims to conduct an analysis on E-Commerce data. The data chosen to be used in this analysis is a brazilian dataset of orders made through Olist Store, a startup that provides a platform for business owners to sell their products in marketplaces with the needed technical support. The retrieved information can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a powerful resource to understand costumers and sellers pattern of behaviour in online shopping, which then allows the possibility to increase efficiancy based on the consumption overview.
